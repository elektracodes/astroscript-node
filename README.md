# AstroScript

Node.JS Library of astronomical calculations, aimed for astrology software.

There are many astronomical libraries available in the public domain. While
giving accurate results, they often suffer from lack of convenient API,
documentation and maintainability. Most of the source code is written in C, C++
or Java, and not dynamic languages. So, it is not easy for a layman to customize
them for her custom application, be it an online lunar calendar, horoscope or
tool for amateur sky observations. This library is an attempt to find a
middle-ground between precision on the one hand and compact, well organized
code on the other.

Most of the calculations are based on _"Astronomy With Your Personal Computer"_,
by _Peter Duffett-Smith_.
